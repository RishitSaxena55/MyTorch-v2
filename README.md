> **"A visionary deep learning framework to understand and build the future of transformers from the ground up."**

MyTorch-v1 is not just a codebase—it’s a journey into the inner mechanics of intelligence. This open-source research-grade deep learning library builds both **decoder-only** and **encoder-decoder transformer architectures** from scratch, illuminating every layer, mask, and token that drives the world’s most powerful AI models.

## 🌌 Vision

MyTorch was built with one goal: to **demystify transformers**. While industry giants use abstracted APIs, MyTorch opens the black box and teaches you how to **construct GPT-like models and Whisper-style ASR systems from the bottom up**. It's an educational tool, a research platform, and a modular engineering system in one.

## 💡 Why MyTorch Stands Out

| Feature | MyTorch | HuggingFace | Fairseq |
|--------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Transformer from Scratch | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| No Framework Dependency | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Speech + Text | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| Fully Test-Covered | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| Educational | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ |

## 📣 Real-World Use Cases

- 📖 Build GPT-style chat models
- 🗣️ Train Whisper-style ASR systems
- 🏫 Use in NLP and speech education
- 🔬 Conduct research in low-resource language modeling
- ⚙️ Experiment with decoding strategies

---

## 🔬 Design Philosophy

MyTorch is designed on 3 principles:

1. **Transparency**: Every attention score, every token, every probability is visible and traceable.
2. **Extensibility**: New features like rotary embeddings or relative position bias can be added easily.
3. **Educational Power**: Designed to help you understand *why* each part matters.
