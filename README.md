# ðŸ”¦ MyTorch: A Minimal PyTorch-like Deep Learning Library

Welcome to **MyTorch**, a minimalist deep learning library implemented from scratch.

This project is designed to replicate core features of PyTorch's `nn.Module` and autograd systems, providing a hands-on understanding of how deep learning libraries work under the hood.

# Features:

I have implemented basic MLP models, Activations, Criterion, Losses, CNN, RNN, CTC, GRU, Beam Search, Greedy Search.
