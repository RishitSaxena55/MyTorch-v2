> **"A visionary deep learning framework to understand and build the future of transformers from the ground up."**

MyTorch-v1 is not just a codebase—it’s a journey into the inner mechanics of intelligence. This open-source research-grade deep learning library builds both **decoder-only** and **encoder-decoder transformer architectures** from scratch, illuminating every layer, mask, and token that drives the world’s most powerful AI models.

## 🌌 Vision

The vision of MyTorch is rooted in transparency and self-reliance. It empowers students, researchers, and engineers to break free from the abstraction-heavy frameworks and engage with the real mathematics, tensor flows, and training mechanics that drive transformer models. Whether you’re a beginner aiming to learn or an expert prototyping new architectures, MyTorch gives you control and clarity.

## 💡 Why MyTorch Stands Out

This project isn't just another transformer framework—it fills the crucial educational and architectural gap that mainstream libraries avoid. MyTorch offers a hands-on journey where every layer is crafted manually, encouraging deep understanding while enabling experimentation.

| Feature                  | MyTorch              | HuggingFace     | Fairseq      |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| Transformer from Scratch | ✅ Built line-by-line | ❌ Abstracted    | ❌ Predefined |
| No Framework Dependency  | ✅ PyTorch only       | ❌ Heavy deps    | ❌            |
| Speech + Text            | ✅ Native support     | ⚠️ Text-focused | ✅            |
| Fully Test-Covered       | ✅ High coverage      | ⚠️ Partial      | ✅            |
| Educational              | ✅ Designed to teach  | ⚠️ Complex      | ❌            |

## 📣 Real-World Use Cases

Use MyTorch to explore, experiment, or launch real-world applications:

* 📖 **GPT-like Chatbot Prototypes** — Build custom LLMs from scratch for dialog systems
* 🗣️ **Whisper-style ASR** — Full speech-to-text pipeline with decoding and LM rescoring
* 🏫 **Courses & Bootcamps** — Use MyTorch as a teaching backbone in NLP/ML curriculum
* 🔬 **Research Experiments** — Prototype decoding, embeddings, memory compression, and more
* ⚙️ **Inference Optimization** — Tweak beam size, cache attention maps, and test latency

---

## 🔬 Design Philosophy

Every line of MyTorch was written with care and purpose:

1. **Transparency** — Everything from softmax to beam decoding is visible and modifiable.
2. **Extensibility** — Add rotary embeddings, custom loss, relative attention with minimal effort.
3. **Testability** — Modular design and independent submodules allow unit testing at scale.
4. **Education First** — Variable names, module structure, and docstrings all aim to clarify.
5. **Minimalism** — Only essential abstractions are kept. Simplicity leads to clarity.
